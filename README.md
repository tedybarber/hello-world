# hello-world
Hi there,
The name is Tedy. Here in Washington, the weather is super cold unlike the all-year round tropical weather I'm used to back in American Samoa. I go to Saint Martin's University and its pretty great so far. My studies on the other hand have waivered a bit here and there, but that's another boring story to tell. Well, that's all for now. Hope to see you guys later.
